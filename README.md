## General info

MR. COFFEE will be a internet connected chess-playing robot. It'll allow users to play in human-machine mode (my custom UCI engine) or human-human mode, where robot serves as a remote hand for connected player. Build thread on twitter is a simple tech blog. After release of final verison of robot, I'll write an article and post full codebase.
